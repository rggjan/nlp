# How does it work
We built a little DOM. A "Word" consists of multiple "Splittings". A "Splitting" has a "WordPart" in the role
prefix, stem and suffix


	"Word" 1--* "Splitting" 1-Prefix-1 "WordPart"
    	                	1-Stem-1 "WordPart"
        	            	1-Suffix-1 "WordPart"

A "Text" contains prefixes, stems and suffixes which are unique within the text. (In one text instance,
there are no two suffixes with the same name)


## Text parsing

In a first step, the text is read using the *Text* class. In there, some normalization is done (like
removing of uppercase letters and punctuation). After that, a list of all unique words together
with their word counts is generated.

### Splittings

The splittings are generated by the word class. All possible splittings are generated
(using a double loop).

## Finite state Transducer

We decided to implement our own FST, since OpenFST was not available for java. Also we thought we could
benefit in learning something about the mechanics of FSTs when we implemented it ourselves.

There is no single class capturing the concept of the FST. First, the states and the links are 
constructed. Then a configuration is initialized with the start state, the tapes and a result collector.

Then the configuration is beeing run. The configuration recursively creates copies of the itself
and lets the copies traverse the links. Whenever a configuration reaches an accepting state, the 
configuration is passed to the result collector.  
 
### Weights
Each link has a weight, and the weights are summed up in the configurations as they traverse the links.

### FstPrinter
The FstPrinter traverses a state graph and creates a textual representation of the graph, suitable
for the dot tool (which is part of GraphViz)

### ResultCollector
The result collector collects the results of running an FST. 

## Strategy

### Analyzer

Our general strategy for the Analyzer was as follows: After having generated all the possible prefixes, stems and suffixes, we generate a big FST that
consists (basically) of a start, a middle and a stop state. Then, all the prefixes with their respective weights are added as edges between the start and
the middle state (for example transducing "up" to "up^"). The same thing happens for stems ("house" to "house") and suffixes ("ing" to "^ing").

At the end, we can just run the transducer and get (throught the weights) different estimates on where the splitting could be done.

### Expander

The FST of the affix expander starts with links for each
prefix to a common post prefix state. From there there is a
link for each stem to a per stem pre suffix state. From there
there is a link for each possible suffix, followed by a FST
generating all possible forms (prefix/suffix combinations) 
of the particular stem.

Only the weights of the parsing part of the FST's are set,
the weights of the generating part are all set to zero.

Therefore, the probabilities of the accepting configurations 
depend only on the score of the parsing.

### Weights

We tried different strategies for the weights in the final FSTs. The general idea was to take the sum over the number of times the wordpart was seen
as a first approximation of its probability. For example, when we see "ing" 10 times *as suffix* in different *unique* words,
then we weight it with a factor 10 in the final FST.

#### Depending on Word count

One adaption we tried was not to count it per *unique* word, but per word. For example, having seen "raising, raising, raising, melted, melting" should
give the splitting "melting" a higher probability than the splitting "melted", because the "ing" had been seen much more often than the "ed" form.

However, this did not improve the results much, so we abandoned it again.

#### Depending on Splitting probability

We also implemented a weighted that was inverted proportional to the number of valid splittings per word. That means, the more different splittings
the word has, the less weight each splitting receives. For example, a word with two possible splittings ("house" => {"hou^se", "hous"e"}) would give
each wordpart in each splitting 1/2 weight, while a word with three possible splittings ("housing" => {"hous^ing", "hou^sing", "housi^ng"}) would
assign a weight of 1/3 to each wordpart.

This method, also, did not increase the correctness of the FST much. Especially the stems of long words became very unlikely, and often outweighted
by **strange** pre- and suffixes.

#### Depending on word part length

The last and really successful adaption to the basic weighting we did was to make it dependent on the word part lenght. With the basic
weighting, the main problem was that prefixes and suffixes like "a" and "e" (that consisted of single letters) were extremely common.
Because there are only 26 of them they were too much overweighted.

To correct that, we thought about the following: Instead of using the absolute count of each prefix, we use the relative count, compared
to the average count of all the other prefixes (stems/suffixes respectively) with the same count: Weight =
wortpart.count / wordpart.average.count = wordpart.count / (wordpart(length).sum / wordpart(length).size) =
wordpart.count * wordpart(length).size / wordpart(length).sum

We see, the weight is proportional to the number of other wordparts with the same size. So, for a certain prefix (stem/suffix), the weight is equal
to the number of times it is seen multiplied by the number of different wordparts with the same length.

In the end, this gave us quite good results, so thats the solution that is implemented right now.
